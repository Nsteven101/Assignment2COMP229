    My mission is to create meaningful software solutions that empower people,
    simplify complexity, and bridge the gap between technology and human needs.
    I strive to code with clarity, design with empathy, and teach with purpose.
    Driven by a philosophy that values creativity and open-mindedness, I approach
    coding as an opportunity for free expression, consciously avoiding limitations
    imposed by current industry trends or conventional practices.
